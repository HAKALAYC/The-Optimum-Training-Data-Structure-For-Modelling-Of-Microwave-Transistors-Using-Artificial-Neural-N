# The-Optimum-Training-Data-Structure-For-Modelling-Of-Microwave-Transistors-Using-Artificial-Neural

In this work, the optimum amount of training data for modelling of microwave transistors using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is studied. 
For this purpose, BPF 640 having wide operation frequency range within the large bias voltage and 
current range is chosen and optimum training data amount is determined for its accurate and rapid modelling. 
According to its Manufacturerâ€™s Data Sheets, BPF 640 has the operation frequency from 10 MHz up to 10 GHz 
within the region of 1V<VDS<4V and 1mA<IDS<20mA. Interpolation is chosen for the MLP for the generalization process 
since MLP is generalizing successfully in interpolation mode.
In congress, all the details of models and comparisons will be presented.
